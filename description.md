# Binary Converter
 
### Quick Overview
For my [microbit](https://microbit.org/) program I decided to make a simple binary converter that takes _base 10 numbers_ and converts them to binary. This converter can only convert a maximum number of **31**.

### How to Use
1. To input the number the user simply presses a to add 1 to the number and b to subtract 1 from the number. The number will be shown on the led display. 
2. After the number is chosen the user will press both a and b buttons at the same time to convert it to binary.
